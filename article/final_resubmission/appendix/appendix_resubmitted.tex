Additional information on Factor Analysis

We used an oblique rotation which allows for factors to be correlated. This is
  appropriate here because, while we argue that moral statism and
  anti-governmentalism are unique and distinct, they are likely to be
  correlated. We use maximum likelihood as the factoring method because
  it has a more formal statistical basis than other methods and is
  widely seen as one of the optimal methods. See Fabrigar et al. (1999). We estimate two factors, which a scree plot (below) suggests to be the optimal number.
  
For \emph{N} equal to 5914, a chi-square test of the null hypothesis that
  two factors are sufficient is equal to 878 with a p-value of 0,
  suggesting that two factors are not sufficient, as we would expect.
  That said, the root mean square of the residuals is 0.05 and the
  Tucker-Lewis Index for factor reliability score is 0.8, both of which
  are near the conventional cutoffs of .05 and .9, respectively.

\subsubsection{Does Misarchism Also Predict Republican Party Identification or Conservatism?}\label{alternative-dvs}

Does the misarchist interaction of moral statism and
anti-governmentalism also drive Republican Party identification and/or
conservative identification? The answer matters for understanding how
these model results improve our understanding of American conservatism.
If a misarchist perspective is associated with Republican Party
identification or identification with conservatism in general, our
findings may only reflect a substrate of American conservatism but not
necessarily Tea Party support per se. To check this possibility, we run
two additional models similar to Model 2 but using ordinary least
squares estimation with \emph{PartyID} and \emph{Conservatism} on the
left-hand side of the model equation instead of the right-hand side. To
save space, we provide only a brief discussion of the results here, with
full model results available in the Supplementary Information. Moral
statism positively predicts and governmentalism negatively predicts
Republican identification with high levels of statistical significance,
but the coefficient for the interaction term is nearly zero and
statistically insignificant. On the other hand, considering conservative
self-identification as the dependent variable, while both moral statism
and governmentalism are again signed as expected, the interaction term
is positive and significant. These results suggest that the misarchist
interaction of moral statism and anti-governmentalism is positively
associated with Tea Party support in a fashion irreducible to simple
Republican Party identification or conservative identification. A
substantive interpretation consistent with these auxiliary models is
that the Republican Party is home to morally statist as well as
anti-government and pro-government attitudes (a ``broad church''
encompassing various forms of conservatism). On the other hand, the Tea
Party is uniquely associated with the combination of morally statist and
anti-government attitudes whereas simple ``conservatism'' is uniquely
associated with morally statist and pro-government attitudes. Because
these are not our primary, theoretically motivated arguments, caution
should be exercised in making inferences from these auxilliary models.
Nonetheless, they strengthen support for our argument and contradict the
common interpretation of Tea Party supporters as simply extreme
conservatives or extreme Republicans.

Individuals characterized by the highest observed levels of moral
statism also in the 90th percentile of anti-governmentalism (below a
value of -.7 on the governmentalism factor) have a probability of
supporting the Tea Party around 40\%. To be more precise, moving from
minimum to maxium moral statism while in the 10th percentile of
governmentalism increases the probability of supporting the Tea Party by
.39 (sd=.07) more than it would in the 90th percentile of
govermentalism, from .01 (sd=.00) to .42, (sd=.07) rather than .05
(sd=.02) to .03 (sd=.02).

\subsubsection{Bayesian Model Averaging}\label{bayesian-model-averaging}

regression results such as those presented above are sometimes sensitive
to minor differences in model specification, such as including or
excluding one variable. One risk is publication bias, if researchers
prefer models that confirm their hypotheses. Another is loss of
efficiency if too many unnecessary variables are included. Finally, an
\emph{ad hoc} approach leads to incomplete representations of model
uncertainty (J. M. Montgomery and Nyhan 2010, 4).

In particular, a version of the R package \emph{BMA} modified by
Mongtomery and Nyhan was used to search over the entire model space of
Model 2.\footnote{The analysis was conducted using the
  \emph{bic.glmMN()} function, which is a version of the
  \emph{bic.glm()} function in the R package \emph{BMA}. See (Raftery et
  al. 2015) and (J. M. Montgomery and Nyhan 2010)} The analysis uses
uniform priors for all independent variables and the only restriction is
that the interaction term and its two component variables are required
to enter or not enter models together.\footnote{Options were set to be
  least restrictive. No Occam's Window was used to narrow the models
  selected by the initial leap algorithm run over the entire model space
  and, following Montgomery and Nyhan (pp.~21), the number of best
  models of each size returned by the leaps algorithm was set to 100,000}
In the end, 8,192 models were selected.

The results show that the misarchist terms are highly robust to model
selection, with a posterior probability of inclusion equal to 100\% (one
minus the cumulative posterior probability of all models excluding
them). The expected value of the coefficient for \emph{MoralStatism} is
-0.16 (sd=.26), suggesting it has no independent effect. for
\emph{Governmentalism} it is -.76 (sd=.25), and for the interaction term
it is -1.07 (sd=.31). \emph{Obama}, \emph{FoxNews}, and
\emph{Conservatism} also had probabilities of inclusion equal to 100\%
with signs consistent with Model 2. \emph{Age}, \emph{Race}, and
\emph{BornAgain} had probabilities of inclusion greater than 25\% but
did not show expected values statistically distinguishable from zero.
All other variables had probabilities of inclusion less than 50\%. More
detailed graphical information is reported in Supplementary Information.

In the main models reported above, we have consciously chosen to include
a large number of control variables because we are presently most
concerned with testing our hypotheses and ruling out rival hypotheses.
BMA provides further evidence that the models presented above likely
contain superfluous independent variables. Though we believe it is best
to rely primarily on the conservative estimates reported above, we
briefly report how our coefficients of interest would change under
different specifications suggested by the BMA. In a model with just
those variables found to be the most robust to model selection
(\emph{Conservatism}, \emph{Fox News}, \emph{Obama},
\emph{MoralStatism}, and \emph{Governmentalism}), moving from 10th
percentile of \emph{MoralStatism} to 90th within the 10th percentile of
\emph{Governmentalism} (strong libertarian), is associated with the
probablitity of supporting the Tea Party increasing about 9\% (sd=.03)
from .09 (sd=.03) to .19 (sd=.03). Thus, the results from Bayesian Model
Averaging suggest the main result reported in the article is robust to model
selection.

\subsubsection{Multiple Imputation}\label{multiple-imputation}

In particular, if relative misarchists were more (or less) likely to
respond to certain questions than other respondents, we may have
over-estimated (or under-estimated) the true partial correlation between
our misarchist terms and Tea Party support. Multiple imputation refers
to the process of using the information from observed variables to infer
the most likely values for all missing cells. The process finishes by
producing a set of new datasets each of which samples from the
predictive distribution to assign most likely values to each missing
cell. After multiple imputation, the models discussed above are
re-estimated on each imputed dataset and the results are combined using
``Rubin's rules.'' Specifically, we use the R package \emph{Amelia}
(Honaker, King, and Blackwell 2008) to generate 10 versions of the ANES
dataset with missing values imputed and \emph{Zelig} (Imai, King, and Lau 2009) to obtain pooled
regression results. The multiple imputation algorithm only assumes that
missing values are ``missing at random,'' not necessarily ``missing
completely at random.'' In this context, ``missing at random'' only
means that missingness is dependent on the observed variables.

After pooling the results, the estimates remain substantially the same.
\emph{MoralStatism}, \emph{Governmentalism}, and the interaction term
remain signed as in Model 2 with high statistical significance (.98,
p\textless{}.00; -.68, p\textless{}.00; -1.35, p\textless{}.00,
respectively). \emph{FoxNews} and \emph{BornAgain} also remain
substantially the same. Graphical diagnostics for overimputation,
dispersion, and comparing pre- and post-imputation densities for our
main variables suggest no problems or anomolies in the imputation
procedures. \clearpage

\subsubsection{Matching and Sensitivity}\label{matching-and-sensitivity}

The algorithm obtains the matched pairs of those ``treated'' and not
treated to governmentalism and moral statism which are otherwise
optimally balanced in the propensity to be treated. The average
treatment effect for the treated obtained from this subset will
approximate that which we would obtain from a randomized experiment,
unless some unobserved factor shapes the propensity to be treated.
Although the possibility of omitted variables can never be ruled out, we
can quantify the sensitivity of these matching estimates to some
potential unobserved source of bias. Thus, we also report sensitivity
bounds as developed by Rosenbaum (1988), using the R package \emph{rbounds} (Keele 2014).

We generate matching estimates for the effect of governmentalism and the
interaction term, one at a time, using one-to-one genetic matching with
replacement (Sekhon 2011). We ignore moral statism because the main analyses suggest
it does not have an independent effect. In each case, ``treatment'' is
defined as having a value above the sample mean of the variable of
interest. For each estimate, we balance on all covariates in Model 2
except the two components of the interaction term and including the
treatment variable's propensity scores with respect to those covariates.
We do not balance on the components of the interaction term, or the
interaction term itself, because this would remove the covariation of
governmentalism and moral statism the effect of which we wish to test,
but we do include the components and the interaction term as covariates.

The average treatment effect on those ``treated'' with greater than the
mean level of governmentalism is -0.025, with a standard error of 0.012
(p=.04). The Rosenbaum bounds for this effect suggest that for it to
become statistically insignificant at the 95\% confidence level, the
odds of differential assignment to treatment due to an unobserved factor
would have to be about 1.45. The average treatment effect on those
``treated'' with greater than the mean level of the interaction term is
-0.022, with a standard error of 0.01 and a (p=.03). The Rosenbaum
bounds for this effect suggest that for it to become statistically
insignificant at the 95\% confidence level, the odds of differential
assignment to treatment due to an unobserved factor would have to be
about 1.39. The direction and statistical significance of the key
relationship in Model 2 (the interaction term), and one of its
independent components (governmentalism), do not appear to be spurious
artifacts of systematic assignment into treatment from any of the other
main covariates making individuals more likely to be misarchist.

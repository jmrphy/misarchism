  After controlling for attitudes, white people are less likely to support the Tea Party than non-white people. These findings draw our attention to non-negligible support for the Tea Party from non-white people. In our sample, `r round(prop.table(table(factor.vars$white, factor.vars$tea_supp), 1)[4], digits=3)*100`% of white people report support for the Tea Party (`r round(prop.table(table(factor.vars$white, factor.vars$tea_supp), 2)[4], digits=3)*100`% of total Tea Party supporters). `r round(prop.table(table(factor.vars$white, factor.vars$tea_supp), 1)[3], digits=3)*100`% of black people report support for the Tea Party (`r round(prop.table(table(factor.vars$white, factor.vars$tea_supp), 2)[3], digits=3)*100`% of total Tea Party supporters).
